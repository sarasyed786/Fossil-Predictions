# Fossil-Predictions - Predict the Age of a Fossil

## About Dataset

The Fossil dataset was created to provide a comprehensive and realistic foundation for training and evaluating machine learning models aimed at predicting fossil ages. The dataset includes a variety of geological, chemical, and physical attributes that are significant in the study of fossil formation and preservation.

## Features

**uranium_lead_ratio:** Ratio of uranium to lead isotopes in the fossil sample.

**carbon_14_ratio:** Ratio of carbon-14 isotopes present in the fossil sample.

**radioactive_decay_series:** Measurement of the decay series from parent to daughter isotopes.

**stratigraphic_layer_depth:** Depth of the fossil within the stratigraphic layer, in meters.

**isotopic_composition:** Proportion of different isotopes within the fossil sample.

**fossil_size:** Size of the fossil, in centimeters.

**fossil_weight:** Weight of the fossil, in grams.

**geological_period:** Geological period during which the fossil was formed.

**surrounding_rock_type:** Type of rock surrounding the fossil.

**paleomagnetic_data:** Paleomagnetic orientation data of the fossil site.

**stratigraphic_position:** Position of the fossil within the stratigraphic column.

**age:** Age of the fossil based on various features, in years.

## Task

Train a non-linear regression model using feature engineering and generalized linear regression model to predict the age of the fossil based on the provided features.
